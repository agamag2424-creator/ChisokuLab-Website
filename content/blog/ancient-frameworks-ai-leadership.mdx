## Introduction

Ancient decision frameworks, tested by leaders for over 3,000 years, offer remarkably relevant guidance for modern managers navigating AI adoption. These time-tested principles address the core challenges of leadership: making good decisions, managing uncertainty, and staying true to your values.

In this post, I'll explore three key frameworks (originally described in ancient texts like the Bhagavad Gita) and how they apply to leadership in the age of AI.

## The Framework of Core Duty

**The principle:** Each leader has a specific duty based on their role and nature. Fulfilling your duty with excellence, regardless of outcomes, is the path to effective leadership.

**Modern application:** As a manager, your core duty isn't to adopt every AI tool or chase every trend. Your duty is to make decisions that serve your team and organization, even when those decisions are difficult or unpopular.

**Practical example:** When everyone is pressuring you to adopt a new AI tool, ask: Is this aligned with my role as a leader? Does it serve my team's actual needs? If not, your duty might be to say "no" or "not yet."

## The Practice of Action Without Attachment

**The principle:** Act with excellence, but don't be attached to the results. Do your best work, then let go of outcomes you can't control.

**Modern application:** You can't control how AI will evolve or how your team will respond to new tools. You can control how you prepare, how you communicate, and how you support your team through change.

**Practical example:** When rolling out a new AI tool, focus on doing the rollout well—clear communication, proper training, adequate support. Don't obsess over adoption rates or immediate results. Do your part, then let the process unfold.

## The Path of Steady Wisdom

**The principle:** A leader with steady wisdom remains calm and clear-minded regardless of external circumstances. They don't react impulsively to success or failure.

**Modern application:** The AI landscape changes constantly. New tools emerge, old ones fade, trends shift. A leader with steady wisdom doesn't react to every change. They maintain clarity about what matters and make decisions from that place of calm.

**Practical example:** When a competitor adopts a flashy new AI tool, steady wisdom asks: Does this actually matter for our goals? Is this the right time? What's the real opportunity cost?

## Bringing It Together

The core message for modern leaders: Do your duty with excellence, act without attachment to outcomes, and maintain steady wisdom in the face of constant change.

This isn't about being passive or avoiding decisions. It's about making decisions from a place of clarity rather than reactivity.

## Conclusion

Ancient wisdom doesn't become irrelevant just because technology advances. The fundamental challenges of leadership—making good decisions, managing uncertainty, staying true to your values—remain constant.

These time-tested frameworks (originally described in texts like the Bhagavad Gita, written over 2,000 years ago) offer guidance for navigating these challenges with grace and effectiveness, whether you're leading a team through AI adoption or any other transformation.
