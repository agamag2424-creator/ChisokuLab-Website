## Introduction

By 3 PM, you're exhausted. Not from physical work, but from making decisions. Should you approve this request? Which AI tool should the team try? How should you respond to this email?

Decision fatigue is the mental exhaustion that comes from making too many choices. And as a manager in the age of AI, you're making more decisions than ever before.

In this post, I'll share a practical framework for reducing decision fatigue and making better choices.

## Why Decision Fatigue Happens

Every decision, no matter how small, uses mental energy. When you start the day with hundreds of micro-decisions—what to wear, what to eat, which task to tackle first—you have less mental energy left for the decisions that actually matter.

Research shows that judges make worse decisions later in the day, and people are more likely to make impulsive purchases when they're mentally tired. The same applies to managers making decisions about AI tools, team priorities, and strategic direction.

## The Framework: Three Types of Decisions

### Type 1: Routine Decisions (Automate or Delegate)

These are decisions you make repeatedly with similar inputs. Examples: Which AI tool to use for a specific task, how to structure meeting notes, when to schedule one-on-ones.

**Solution:** Create systems, templates, or rules that handle these decisions automatically. For example: "We always use ChatGPT for brainstorming, Otter.ai for meeting transcription."

### Type 2: Important Decisions (Use a Process)

These are decisions that matter but don't require perfect optimization. Examples: Which AI tool to adopt for the team, how to structure a new project, whether to attend a conference.

**Solution:** Use a structured decision-making process:
1. Define the decision clearly
2. List 3-5 criteria that matter
3. Evaluate options against criteria
4. Make a decision and commit
5. Set a review date (don't second-guess)

### Type 3: Critical Decisions (Deep Thinking)

These are decisions that significantly impact your team or organization. Examples: Major AI transformation initiatives, strategic pivots, key hires.

**Solution:** Schedule dedicated time for these decisions. Don't make them when you're tired. Use frameworks, get input, sleep on it.

## Practical Strategies

### 1. Batch Similar Decisions

Instead of deciding throughout the day, batch similar decisions together. For example, review all tool requests on Friday afternoons, not as they come in.

### 2. Set Decision Rules

Create "if-then" rules for common situations. "If a team member requests a new AI tool, then I'll evaluate it against our three criteria: solves real problem, fits our workflow, has good support."

### 3. Reduce Daily Micro-Decisions

Simplify your morning routine, meal planning, and other daily choices. Save your mental energy for decisions that matter.

### 4. Use Decision Deadlines

Set a deadline for decisions. "I'll decide on this by Friday." This prevents endless deliberation and forces clarity.

## The Chisoku Approach

In Hindu decision science, there's a concept called "Chisoku" (calm decision-making). It's about making decisions from a place of clarity rather than reactivity.

The key principles:
- **Slow down** before important decisions
- **Clarify** what you're actually trying to achieve
- **Detach** from the pressure to decide immediately
- **Act** with confidence once you've decided

## Conclusion

Decision fatigue isn't inevitable. By categorizing decisions, creating systems, and using structured processes, you can make better choices with less mental energy.

The goal isn't to eliminate decisions—it's to make them more effectively and preserve your mental energy for the choices that truly matter.
