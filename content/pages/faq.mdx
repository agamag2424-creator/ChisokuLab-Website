## General

### What is Chisoku?

Chisoku is a concept from Hindu decision science that means 'calm decision-making.' It's about making decisions from a place of clarity rather than reactivity, especially when navigating uncertainty and change.

### How is this different from other AI training?

Most AI training focuses on tools and techniques. We combine AI efficiency training with decision science principles, helping you not just use AI tools, but make confident decisions about which tools to use, when, and why.

### Do I need to be familiar with Hindu philosophy?

No, you don't need any prior knowledge of Hindu philosophy. We explain the relevant concepts in practical, modern terms that apply directly to leadership and decision-making challenges.

### How do I get started?

You can start by exploring our free resources, reading our blog, or enrolling in the course. For enterprise consulting, join the waitlist to be notified when services launch.
