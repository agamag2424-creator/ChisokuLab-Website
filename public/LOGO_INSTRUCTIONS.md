# Logo File Instructions

The logo image file needs to be placed in this directory (`public/`) with the filename `logo.png`.

## Steps to Add Logo:

1. Save your logo image file as `logo.png` in the `public/` folder
2. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
3. Recommended dimensions: 
   - Width: 200px (or maintain aspect ratio)
   - Height: 40px (or maintain aspect ratio)
   - The logo will scale automatically while maintaining aspect ratio

## Current Setup:

- The logo component is configured to display `/logo.png`
- If the image fails to load, it will automatically fallback to text "ChisokuLab"
- Logo appears in:
  - Header (desktop): 200x40px
  - Header (mobile menu): 160x32px  
  - Footer: 200x40px

## File Location:

Place your logo file here:
`/Users/agamagrawal/Documents/Chisoku Lab website/chisokulab/public/logo.png`
